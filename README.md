## Re-analysis of mobile mRNA datasets raises questions about the extent of long-distance mRNA communication

List of figures / tables:

- Table 1: Total numbers of reported mobile mRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana (2) and Vitis girdiana (3) that can be explained by expected sequencing noise.
- Figure 2: The distributions of nucleotides at SNP and non-SNP positions can be informative for evaluating the evidence for the alternate allele.
- Supplemental Fig. S1. Published criteria for defining mobile mRNAs based on absolute read counts suffer from read-depth dependencies.
- Supplemental Fig. S6. The uncertainty in the determination of the error rate depends on the read depth.
- Supplemental Fig. S7. Most SNPs in mobile mRNAs do hav enot evidence for the alternate allele.
- Supplemental Fig. S8. Overlay of the ratios of nucleotides at SNP and non-SNP position.
- Supplemental Fig. S9. Some datasets exhibit features that can be interpreted either as non-selective whole transcriptome movement or contamination. 
- Supplemental Fig. S 10. Genome assembly incompleteness can lead to mapping challenges that may result in the identification of non-mobile transcripts being defined as mobile.
